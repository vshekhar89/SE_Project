    <string name="help_text">"Welcome to Air Hockey Classic HD. This is a high definition version of the classic arcade Air Hockey game.

The winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.

From the menu screen you may select one of 3 difficulty levels, 3 playing modes and 2 themes (day or night). In single player mode you can select which mallet you wish to play with. You can also select a two player mode where you can play against yourself or a friend. There is a demo mode available where the Android device will play against itself untill the Android device back button is pressed.

You can move the mallets, either by dragging them towards either side of the screen, or by touching the screen where you would like the mallet to go to.

You can touch the centre of the screen to pause the game, and touch again to restart the game.

At the end of the game, touch the screen to return to the main menu.

After a game in single player mode has finished, the menu screen will display the percentage of games won by the player for the current level of difficulty.

You can scroll the menu screen up and down to access all the menu options:
 * Changing the number of players;
 * Change the number of points needed to win the game, or set a time duration for the game;
 * Changing the difficulty level;
 * Changing the theme of the game;
 * Adjusting the sound effect volume;
 * Reset the score percentages for all difficulty levels.

If you enjoy the game, try the Pro version, which includes:
 * No Adverts;
 * More challenging game play.

Good luck and we wish you hours of fun!"</string>
